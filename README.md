Data Sourcing: Obtain data from a CSV file. 

Real-time Streaming: Leveraging the power of Apache Kafka, the project harnesses its real-time capabilities. The Kafka producer streams data to be consumed by Kafka consumer.

Storage in the Cloud: The consumed data is loaded into AWS S3. This ensures accessibility, scalability, and durability.

Data Visualizations: AWS QuickSight is used for data analytics and visualizations. 

Future Possibilities: Potential of AWS Glue Crawler and Athena. These components can be used for enhanced data manipulation and querying capabilities.
